Official implementation of "Tuning-free Bilevel Optimization"


The folder `benchopt` contains the codes for Regularization Selection and Data Hyper-Cleaning. The fodler `coreset` contains the codes for Coreset Selection for Continual Learning. The former implementation is based on the [benchmark](https://github.com/benchopt/benchmark_bilevel), and the latter is based on the [codebase](https://github.com/MingruiLiu-ML-Lab/Bilevel-Coreset-Selection-via-Regularization).


#### Regularization Selection and Data Hyper-Cleaning
Install the [benchmark](https://github.com/benchopt/benchmark_bilevel), put the scripts into corresponding folders. Then, follow their instructions and run the benchmark.

#### Coreset Selection for Continual Learning
Install the [codebase](https://github.com/MingruiLiu-ML-Lab/Bilevel-Coreset-Selection-via-Regularization), put the script into the `core` folder. Then run the experiments.
